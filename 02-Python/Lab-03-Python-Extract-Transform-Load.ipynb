    "## Using Python to Perform Extract-Transform-Load (ETL Processing)\n",
    "Modern Data Warehousing and Analytics solutions frequently use languages like Python or Scala to extract data from numerous sources, including relational database management systems, NoSQL database systems, real-time streaming endpoints and Data Lakes.  These languages can then be used to perform many types of transformation before then loading the data into a variety of destinations including file systems and data warehouses. This data can then be consumed by data scientists or business analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will recreate the **Northwind_DW** dimensional database from Lab 2; however, you'll take an entirely different approach. Instead of extracting, transforming and loading the date entirely on the database system only using SQL data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements, here you will learn to interact with the RDBMS from a remote client running Python. You will learn to fetch data into Pandas DataFrames, perform all the necessary transformations in-memory on the client, and then push the newly transformed DataFrame back to the RDBMS using a Pandas function that will create the table and fill it with data with a single operation.\n",

The first approach demonstrates that a carefully crafted SQL SELECT statement can be used to perform this task... *but what fun would that be.* Seriously though, this approach is quick and effect if you already have the query, but what if you didn't have the opportunity to view and work with the data beforehand?  What's more, you may be required to combine data from multiple sources, some of which may not be relational database management systems. Then, a simple SQL query won't do!  You would need to load the data from the various sources (e.g., database tables, CSV or JSON files, NoSQL document collections, API stream data) and then combine them into a single dataframe that you could then use to create a new database table.
