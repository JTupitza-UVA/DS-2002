With all data and metadata resident in object storage in the cloud, multiple users and applications can access data in near-real time, allowing analysts to access the freshest data as it's being processed.\n\n![](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/sslh/multi-hop-simple.png)\n\n- **Bronze** tables contain raw data ingested from various sources (JSON files, RDBMS data,  IoT data, to name a few examples).\n- **Silver** tables provide a more refined view of our data. We can join fields from various bronze tables to enrich streaming records, or update account statuses based on recent activity.\n- **Gold** tables provide business level aggregates often used for reporting and dashboarding. This would include aggregations such as daily active website users, weekly sales per store, or gross revenue per quarter by department. \n\nThe end outputs are actionable insights, dashboards and reports of business metrics.  By considering our business logic at all steps of the ETL pipeline, we can ensure that storage and compute costs are optimized by reducing unnecessary duplication of data and limiting ad hoc querying against full historic data.
