Historically, streaming big data has been driven by the need to reduce latency for the sake of providing near real-time analytics; however, this lesson focuses more on implementing incremental data processing.\n\nWhile not absolutely required when working with a *data lakehouse*, many enterprise implementations will derive substantial benefit from incremental data processing. Incremental ETL is important since it allows us to deal solely with new data that has been encountered since the last ingestion. Reliably processing only the new data reduces redundant processing and helps enterprises reliably scale data pipelines.  The first step for any successful data lakehouse implementation is ingesting into a Delta Lake table from cloud storage. Historically, ingesting files from a data lake into a database has been a complicated process; however, Databricks Auto Loader provides an easy-to-use mechanism for incrementally and efficiently processing new data files as they arrive in cloud file storage. Due to the benefits and scalability that Auto Loader delivers, Databricks recommends its use as general **best practice** when ingesting data from cloud object storage.\n\n#### Objectives\n* Execute Auto Loader code to incrementally ingest data from cloud storage to Delta Lake\n* Describe what happens when a new file arrives in a directory configured for Auto Loader\n* Query a table fed by a streaming Auto Loader query\n\n#### 1.0. Import Shared Utilities and Data Files\nThis lab will demonstrate ingesting artificially generated medical data, in JSON format, that simulates heart rate monitor signals captured from numerous devices; therefore, this data represents what would be expected from a *Streaming* data source.\n\n| Field | Type |\n| --- | --- \n| device_id | int |\n| mrn | long |\n| time | double |\n| heartrate | double |\n\nFirst, run the following cell to import the data and make various utilities available for our experimentation."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"46d58e3d-defb-440f-8328-681c92c65762"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run ./Includes/4.0-setup"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"a0616aa5-65da-4059-b641-d74e0111a7c0"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### 2.0. Using Auto Loader\nIn the cell below, a function is defined to demonstrate using Databricks Auto Loader with the PySpark API. This code includes both a Structured Streaming read and write. If you wish to learn more about Auto Loader options, refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/auto-loader.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.\n\nNote that when using Auto Loader with automatic <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/auto-loader-schema.html\" target=\"_blank\">schema inference and evolution</a>, the 4 arguments shown here should allow ingestion of most datasets. These arguments are explained below.\n\n| argument | what it is | how it's used |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **`data_source`** | The directory of the source data | Auto Loader will detect new files as they arrive in this location and queue them for ingestion; passed to the **`.load()`** method |\n| **`source_format`** | The format of the source data |  While the format for all Auto Loader queries will be **`cloudFiles`**, the format of the source data should always be specified for the **`cloudFiles.format`** option |\n| **`table_name`** | The name of the target table | Spark Structured Streaming supports writing directly to Delta Lake tables by passing a table name as a string to the **`.table()`** method. Note that you can either append to an existing table or create a new table |\n| **`checkpoint_directory`** | The location for storing metadata about the stream | This argument is passed to the **`checkpointLocation`** and **`cloudFiles.schemaLocation`** options. Checkpoints keep track of streaming progress, while the schema location tracks updates to the fields in the source dataset |\n\n**NOTE**: The code below has been streamlined to demonstrate Auto Loader functionality. Later we'll see how additional transformations can be applied to source data before saving them to Delta Lake."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"01d0c8e7-13c9-4579-ab03-188ac45c8f61"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def autoload_to_table(data_source, source_format, table_name, checkpoint_directory):\n    query = (spark.readStream\n                  .format(\"cloudFiles\")\n                  .option(\"cloudFiles.format\", source_format)\n                  .option(\"cloudFiles.schemaLocation\", checkpoint_directory)\n                  .load(data_source)\n                  .writeStream\n                  .option(\"checkpointLocation\", checkpoint_directory)\n                  .option(\"mergeSchema\", \"true\")\n                  .table(table_name))\n    return query"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"9ba3a3ff-db46-46f8-a1cb-218e570ac4df"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We will now use the previously defined function and some path variables defined in the setup script to begin an Auto Loader stream that reads from a source directory of JSON files."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"a60959e4-7cc4-4693-bed4-8234c824533f"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["query = autoload_to_table(data_source = f\"{DA.paths.working_dir}/tracker\",\n                          source_format = \"json\",\n                          table_name = \"target_table\",\n                          checkpoint_directory = f\"{DA.paths.checkpoints}/target_table\")\n"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"f52ae997-8cfc-4fb6-83f4-ac242ad4fd34"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Because Auto Loader uses Spark Structured Streaming to load data incrementally, the code above doesn't appear to finish executing.
